#  Hangman {Python Game}
Here's a brief description of its functionality:

1. **Setup**: The code begins by importing necessary modules and data from `hangman_words.py` and `hangman_art.py`. It then selects a random word from the word list for the game and sets up the initial game state.

2. **Game Start**: The game starts by printing the Hangman logo and the blanks for the chosen word.

3. **Guessing Letters**: The main game loop starts, where it asks the player to guess a letter. If the player guesses a letter they've already guessed, it informs them and asks for another guess.

4. **Checking Guesses**: For each new guess, it checks if the guessed letter is in the chosen word. If it is, it reveals that letter in all its positions in the word. If not, it informs the player that the letter is not in the word and reduces their remaining lives by one.

5. **End Conditions**: The game ends when either all letters in the word have been guessed (player wins), or when the player has no lives left (player loses). At each stage of the game, it prints out a visual representation of the Hangman based on how many lives are left.

This code provides a complete implementation of a console-based Hangman game.

## Tech Stack
The specific ‚Äútech stack‚Äù for this game includes:

Python: The core language used to implement the game logic.
Python Standard Library: Used for functionalities like random choice (random.choice), user input (input()), and string manipulation.
Google Colab: It seems you‚Äôre running this code in Google Colab, which is a cloud-based Python notebook service.
The game also relies on two custom Python modules:

hangman_words.py: This module contains the list of words that the game can choose from.
hangman_art.py: This module contains ASCII art for the hangman stages and the game logo.
These modules are part of your project‚Äôs codebase and aren‚Äôt part of any larger framework or library. These are specific to my game.

## Lessons Learned
Building a game like Hangman in Python can teach you several important programming concepts and skills:

1. **Control Structures**: The game loop uses a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player wins or loses. Inside this loop, `if` statements are used to check the player's guesses and update the game state.

2. **Data Structures**: Lists are used to store the letters of the chosen word and the player's current guesses. This teaches you how to work with one of Python's basic data structures.

3. **Functions and Modules**: The code uses functions from the `random` module in the Python Standard Library, as well as custom modules (`hangman_words` and `hangman_art`). This can help you understand how to use and create your own modules and functions.

4. **Input/Output**: The game takes input from the player using Python's `input()` function, and prints output using the `print()` function. This can help you understand how to interact with users in a console application.

5. **Error Handling**: The code includes checks to handle situations like the player guessing a letter they've already guessed. This can introduce you to the concept of error checking and handling in your code.

6. **Problem Solving**: Implementing a game like Hangman requires problem-solving skills to figure out how to translate the rules of the game into code.

7. **Code Organization**: The use of TODO comments in the code can teach you about organizing and planning your code, making it easier to read and maintain.
